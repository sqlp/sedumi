## SeDuMi: Optimization over symmeric cones

SeDuMi is a Matlab package for solving convex optimization problems involving linear equations and inequalities, second-order cone constraints, and semidefinite constraints (linear matrix inequalities). The original version was developed by Jos. F. Sturm, who sadly passed away in 2003. Development continued under the direction of [Prof. Tamás Terlaky](http://coral.ie.lehigh.edu/~terlaky/) by former Ph.D. students Imre Pólik and Oleksandr Romanko. 

Of course, like many open-source projects, it has benefitted considerably from contributions by others, including the developers of [YALMIP](http://users.isy.liu.se/johanl/yalmip/) and [CVX](http://cvxr.com), two modeling frameworks for optimization that use SeDuMi as a solver. The authors of these packages co-administer this repo, along with [Jonathan Currie](http://www.i2c2.aut.ac.nz/) from AUT University.

Please note that this is an *unofficial* repository for SeDuMi. The [official SeDuMi site](http://coral.ie.lehigh.edu/~newsedumi/) is hosted by the [CORAL Lab](http://coral.ie.lehigh.edu/) at the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](http://www.lehigh.edu/ise/) at [Lehigh University](http://www.lehigh.edu/). *We do not intend for this repository to remain a permanent fork from the official SeDuMi release.* All improvements that we make here are communicated to the official SeDuMi maintainers for inclusion in the official release.

You are welcome to submit bug reports on the [GitHub issue page](https://github.com/sedumi/sedumi/issues). We cannot guarantee that they will be addressed in a timely fashion, we will do our best.
